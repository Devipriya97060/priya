# TCPIP
Async I/O method for establishing the connection between client and the
server has been studied as mentioned in the assignment description. The file
management between the server and client was analysed in python
programming to change, edit and delete the files. The file management has
been studied according to the given modules.
The relation between the old and updated versions of the modules were also
studied in order to implement the file management coding with minimal
redundancy. The async I/O functions were also studied for correct file
command implementation in connection to the given modules.
The async I/O examples given in the assignment modules were also
analysed for connection establishment and code execution.
